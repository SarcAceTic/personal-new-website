        You're probably wondering why you're even reading this. You got into a
        shitty 16 yo's website, either by looking through my Discord profile, or
        you're one of those

        who stumbled upon my website through sheer luck. As of writing this,
        that chance is about...

          >1 in 1.5 billion chance</ULink

        that you actually got to my website! So um... to anyone doing that and
        then taking the time to read to get to this point... Thank you!

        But anyways, hi! My writing skill isn't that good, so I'm gonna be very
        quick. Name's <b class="text-primary">Saryn</b>, if it's not obvious by
        the huge ass website 'Logo' (if you could even call it that...). I do
        Programming, language learning (that also comes with programming
        honestly lol), weightlifting, and yapping. Soooo quirky, right? Yes. I
        know.

        Also if you're not aware, the song that's in the audio player literally
        doesn't match the vibe of the website. I just put that there for cool
        points and to show off I can make audio players. Is it stupid? Maybe. Is
        it cool? Definitely!

      <USeparator color="primary" size="sm" class="my-5" />
      <p>
        I come from Indonesia. I'm also Indonesian, born and raised. At 9-10
        years old, I started to code on my shitty ass
        <NuxtLink
          to="https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_a54-10818.php"
          target="_blank"

        phone. Wait. It wasn't even OPPO A54. It was an older OPPO phone.
        Literally only 4/6 GB of RAM, and 64 GB storage. So yeah. Life was
        tough.
      </p>
      <p class="my-6">
        One of my first creations was this shitty mod I made in GTA: SA Android,
        which is this
        <ULink
          to="https://www.gtainside.com/en/sanandreas/mods/139552-free-shopping-for-android/"
          class="text-primary"
          target="_blank"
          >Free Shopping</ULink
        >
        mod that I created which literally was just changing game parameters.
        But it got <b>10k+ downloads</b> though! I also got featured in a GTA
        YouTuber's channel, but I lost the video somewhere. My mod also got
        reuploaded to tons of sites. Fun!

        <small class="italic text-neutral-500">My first mod's preview</small>
      </div>
      <p class="my-6">
        After that, I made a Discord bot using this
        <ULink
          to="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jakubtomana.discordbotdesinger&hl=en"
          class="text-primary"
          target="_blank"
          >easy-to-code application</ULink
        >
        in Playstore. I literally didn't know how to code because I was just a
        wee wee crybaby lass and didn't understand anything. That app made it
        easy to code, it was literally just using
        <UKbd>${function}</UKbd> syntax to code, and the docs were nice.
      </p>
      <p class="my-6">
        And afterwards I was introduced to coding on
        <ULink class="text-primary" to="https://glitch.com" target="_blank"
          >Glitch</ULink
        >, and it was.. unreal. I started coding Discord bots with
        <ULink class="text-primary" to="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank"
          >Node.js</ULink
        >
        on that website, on a phone. Mind you I wasn't even of legal age to get
        onto Discord. But... I somehow did successfully make a Discord bot that
        only had <b>one</b> command and that was <b>!ping</b>. And
        <b>!guildinfo</b>. Haha.

      <p class="my-6">
        Fast forward to 14 years of age, at this point, I also used
        <ULink
          class="text-primary"
          to="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3&hl=en"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Pydroid 3
        </ULink>
        to make <b>Python</b>-based Discord bots. Also idk what it is with my
        obsession with Discord bots, it's just.. there. Pffft. It's fun. And in
        that year, I actually received my first laptop, a
        <ULink
          class="text-primary"
          to="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/id/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/3-series/ideapad-3-14igl05"
          target="_blank"
          >Lenovo Ideapad 3 14IGL05</ULink
        >, a shitty entry-level laptop which I regretted to rush buying. I KNEW
        I should've gotten a PC.

      <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl text-center">What I do now</h2>
      <USeparator color="primary" size="sm" class="my-5" />
      <p>
        I honestly don't do much at all now. All I can say is, I do some coding
        projects here and there, do some hip training (to hopefully be able to
        crush a watermelon with my bare thighs), and also sleep. I'm sleepy
        right now. Oh yeah, speaking about projects... here they are below! Note
        that I am not listing any of my undeployed projects here due to er...
        laziness. SO IF YOU THINK I LACK PROJECTS, THEN THINK AGAIN!!! I HAVE A
        LOT MORE UNDER MY SLEEVE!
