        You're probably wondering why you're even reading this. You got into a
        shitty 16 yo's website, either by looking through my Discord
        profile, or you're one of those
        <ULink class="text-primary" to="https://theuselessweb.com" target="_blank"
          >Random Web Surfers</ULink
        >
        who stumbled upon my website through sheer luck. As of writing this,
        that chance is about...
        <ULink class="text-primary" to="https://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/" target="_blank">1 in 1.5 billion chance</ULink>
        that you actually got to my website! So um... to anyone doing that and
        then taking the time to read to get to this point... Thank you!

        But anyways, hi! My writing skill isn't that good, so I'm gonna be very
        quick. Name's <b class="text-primary">Saryn</b>, if it's not obvious by
        the huge ass website 'Logo' (if you could even call it that...). I do
        Programming, language learning (that also comes with programming
        honestly lol), weightlifting, and yapping. Soooo quirky, right? Yes. I
        know.

        Also if you're not aware, the song that's in the audio player literally
        doesn't match the vibe of the website. I just put that there for cool
        points and to show off I can make audio players. Is it stupid? Maybe. Is
        it cool? Definitely!

        I come from Indonesia. I'm also Indonesian, born and raised. At 9-10
        years old, I started to code on my shitty ass
        <NuxtLink
          to="https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_a54-10818.php"
          target="_blank"

          >OPPO A54</NuxtLink
        >
        phone. Wait. It wasn't even OPPO A54. It was an older OPPO phone.
        Literally only 4/6 GB of RAM, and 64 GB storage. So yeah. Life was
        tough.
      </p>
      <p class="my-6">
        One of my first creations was this shitty mod I made in GTA: SA Android,
        which is this
        <ULink
          to="https://www.gtainside.com/en/sanandreas/mods/139552-free-shopping-for-android/"
          class="text-primary"
          target="_blank"
          >Free Shopping</ULink
        >
        mod that I created which literally was just changing game parameters.
        But it got <b>10k+ downloads</b> though! I also got featured in a GTA
        YouTuber's channel, but I lost the video somewhere. My mod also got
        reuploaded to tons of sites. Fun!

        <small class="italic">My first mod's preview</small>

      <p class="my-6">
        After that, I made a Discord bot using this
        <ULink
          to="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jakubtomana.discordbotdesinger&hl=en"
          class="text-primary"
          target="_blank"
          >easy-to-code application</ULink
        >
        in Playstore. I literally didn't know how to code because I was just a
        wee wee crybaby lass and didn't understand anything. That app made it
        easy to code, it was literally just using
        <UKbd>${function}</UKbd> syntax to code, and the docs were nice.
